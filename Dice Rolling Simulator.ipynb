    "**Project Report: Dice Rolling Simulator**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Summary:**\n",
    "The Dice Rolling Simulator is a simple Python program that simulates the rolling of a six-sided die. It provides users with a virtual experience of rolling a dice, displaying the resulting value and allowing them to choose whether to roll again. The program utilizes the random module to generate random dice values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Details:**\n",
    "- **Introduction:** The program greets the user and initiates a loop where the user can roll the dice and decide whether to continue or exit.\n",
    "- **Functionality:** It includes a `roll_dice` function that generates a random integer between 1 and 6, simulating a dice roll. The `main` function orchestrates the overall flow of the program.\n",
    "- **User Interaction:** The user is prompted to press Enter to roll the dice. After each roll, the program displays the resulting dice value and asks if the user wants to roll again.\n",
    "- **Termination:** The program exits when the user decides not to roll again, displaying a farewell message.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Keywords:**\n",
    "- **random:** Used to generate random numbers for simulating dice rolls.\n",
    "- **while loop:** Used to create an indefinite loop for continuous user interaction.\n",
    "- **input:** Utilized to capture user input, such as pressing Enter to roll the dice and deciding whether to roll again.\n",
    "- **if statement:** Used to check if the user wants to roll the dice again and to exit the program accordingly.\n",
    "- **lower():** Applied to convert user input to lowercase, ensuring case-insensitive comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Keywords Descriptions:**\n",
    "- **random:** The `random` module is essential for generating random numbers, and in this program, it's employed to simulate the randomness of rolling a six-sided die.\n",
    "- **while loop:** The `while True` loop ensures continuous execution of the program until the user decides to exit, enhancing the interactive experience.\n",
    "- **input:** The `input` function is used to capture user input, enabling the program to wait for the user to press Enter or provide a response.\n",
    "- **if statement:** The `if` statement checks the user's input to determine whether to continue rolling the dice or exit the program, adding a decision-making element to the simulation.\n",
    "- **lower():** The `lower` method is applied to the user's input for case-insensitive comparison, ensuring that variations of 'y' (e.g., 'Y') are recognized as affirmative responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Dice Rolling Simulator project showcases basic Python programming concepts, including user input handling, random number generation, loops, and conditional statements. It offers an engaging and interactive experience for users interested in a virtual dice rolling activity."
